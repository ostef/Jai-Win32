# Jai Win32 Generator
Win32 bindings generator for the Jai programming language.

This module uses the metadata from Microsoft to generate the bindings: https://github.com/marlersoft/win32json, as well as my fork of the Jaison library to parse Json files: https://github.com/ostef/jaison

See `Examples/basics.jai` for an example of how this can be used.
